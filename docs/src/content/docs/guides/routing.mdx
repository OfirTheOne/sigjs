Routing is the process of determining which component to display based on the current URL. 
It is a fundamental part of building single-page applications (SPAs) that have multiple views.

The router has many features like nested routes, route parameters, ranked route matching, 
route guards, navigation events, data loading and more. those features are explained in the "routeing guide" section.

## Creating A Router

`sig` comes with a build in `@sigjs/router` module, providing `Router` functionalities that allows you to define your application's routes and views.

By calling the `createRouter` function with routes config, you create a `router` component.

```tsx showLineNumbers=false
function createRouter(config: RouterConfig): VirtualElement
```

for now, lets focus on the `RouterConfig` property `routes` which is an array of `RouteConfig` objects defining the routes of the application.

## Configuring your routes

A `RouteConfig` object has three main properties:

- `path`: The URL path to match.
- `component`: The component to render when the path matches.
- `children`: An array of nested child routes.

Let's start with a simple example:

Here's two pages, `Home` and `About`:
```tsx
function Home() {
    return <div>Home Page !</div>;
}

function About() {
    return <div>About Page !</div>;
}
```

:::note 
This example uses the `Link` and `router-outlet` components from `sig/router`.

`1` - `Link` component is used instead of the native `a` tag, to do an in-app navigate using the router.

`2` - `router-outlet` tag allows parent route elements to render their child route elements. This allows nested route components to show up when child routes are rendered.

:::

And a common `Layout` component that will be used to wrap the pages:


```tsx {"1":10-11} {"2":16}
import { Link } from "@sigjs/router";
function Layout() {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
            <nav className="flex gap-4">
                <Link className="border text-blue-500" to="/">App Root</Link>
                <Link className="border text-blue-500" to="/about">About</Link>
                <Link className="border text-blue-500" to="/home">Home</Link>
            </nav>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
                <router-outlet />
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Render the router

Now, let's create the router and define the routes:

```tsx 
import { createRouter } from '@sigjs/router';
function AppRouter() {
    return createRouter({
        routes: [{
            path: '/', component: Layout,
            children: [
                { path: '/home', component: About },
                { path: '/about', component: About }
            ],
        }]
    });
}
```

On the root route `/` we define the `Layout` as the route page, in this route we define the child routes `/home` and `/about` with their respective components `Home` and `About`.
In the `Layout` components there's a `router-outlet` tag allowing the child routes to render in the parent `Layout` component.


Finally, render the `AppRouter` component in the `App` component:

```tsx
function App() {
    return <AppRouter />;
}
```

import SimpleRouterAppImage from '../../../assets/SimpleRouterApp_480.gif';

<Image 
    style={{ margin: 'auto', display: 'block' }}
    src={SimpleRouterAppImage} 
    alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs." />
